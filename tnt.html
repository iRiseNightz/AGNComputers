                    <h3>Computer Building</h3>
                    <p>
                       Building your own PC is a thrilling way to get a deeper understanding of how computers work. Not only is it an economical approach to getting a desktop custom-made for your exact needs and wants, but it allows you to get your hands dirty (figuratively, of course) and take true ownership of something you’ll use every day. You’ll finish the project with a sense of pride and a loyal connection to your creation.</p>
                    <p>
                        Joining the build community seems like great idea...until you realize how intimidating it can be. You’ve learned about all the necessary components and peripherals and are ready to invest time and money. But then you’re hit with a wave of uncertainty. How hard is this going to be? Will you really end up with a functioning PC in the end?</p>
                    <p>
                        Approaching your first PC build with a calm, optimistic and eager mindset will help things go smoothly. If you’re not sure on the process for building a PC, check out our how-to guide with step-by-step instructions. To help, we’ve also created this list of beginner’s tips.</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                    <li><h4>Before you do anything, determine the purpose of your build.</h4></li>
                        
                        <p>What’s the reason you’re making this PC? Is it because you want the ultimate gaming machine? Are you looking for something that can handle your creative work, or just want a build that can manage common web browsing? Or do you want a machine that’s as flashy as a nightclub? Maybe it’s a combination of these. In any case, your motivations will influence your decisions when shopping for components.</p>
                        
                    <li><h4>Pick a side: Intel or AMD.</h4></li>
                        
                        <p>Do your research on which CPU has the power and specs you need for your dream build. The CPU will be the core of your PC, so your selection is a very important decision. But it’s not the only component in your computer, so don’t blow your entire budget on it. </p>
                        
                        <p>In short, you can’t wrong with either brand, but which model you choose will determine what kind of motherboard you can get.
